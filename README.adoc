== jpademo

This project contains the RainForest domain model implemented using
Annotations, and has both Hibernate and JPA versions of many of the demo
programs, including the famous (working) ManyToManyDemo.

The domain model is annotated using JPA annotations, and is used by *both
sets of demos - JPA and Hibernate - without change*.

Further, the *JPA demos can run using either Hibernate or EclipseLink
as their JPA provider*; see the persistence.xml file for the properties 
to change.

Currently works with Eclipse (M2E plugin required!) and builds with Maven; 
there are no 'run' type goals configured in Maven.
