You can do what you want with this code.

A few of the files under "domain.model" (formerly known as the "rain"
package, i.e., Recording/MusicRecording/VideoRecording) originated with 
Learning Tree.  The Rainforest package was first built for Course 570;
versions were spun off for various courses; this started with the one for
Course 936, EJB3 and JPA, author Chris Czarnecki.  It was heavily modified
by Ian Darwin and merged with a ton of other code for use as a standalone
JPA and Hibernate Persistence Demo.
