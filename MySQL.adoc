== How to Configure _jpademo_ for the MySQL Database

These are the steps to add MySQL support into the _jpademo_ project.
 
Start MySQL Workbench

Single click Local Instance MySQL

Right click in the schema area to make a pop up come up with the choice to _Create Schema_

Click on _Create Schema_

In the next dialog enter _jpademo.db_ for the name of the schema

Click Apply at the bottom right of this screen.

In the next dialog, _Apply Sql Script to Database_, click _Apply_

The next dialog should say that the SQL script was successfully applied to the database

Click _Finish_ in that dialog
 
To create the account, click on _Users and Privileges_

Click on the _Add Account_ button at the bottom of the Users and Privileges dialog

Enter the details for the account:

. Login Name: student
. Authentication Type: Standard
. Limit to Hosts Matching %
. Password: student

Obviously you should not use student/student in a production environment, nor any that is directly
accessible to the internet. These values are for illustration only; just be sure you remember
the password you use.

Click Apply.
There should now be an account called student in the list of user accounts.
 
With the _student_ account highlighted, click on the Schema Privileges tab

Click the Add Entry button
 
In the New Schema Privilege Definition dialog click the Select schema: radio button, highlight jpademo.db, and click OK

In the dialog that follows click Select _ALL_ and _Apply_
 
You can now close the MySQL workbench.
 
In the _dependencies_ section of the _pom.xml_ file, add this entry for the MySQL driver, 
if not already present:
 
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>mysql</groupId>
   <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
   <version>5.1.33</version>
</dependency>
----
 
In the file _META-INF/persistence.xml_ make sure you have this in the persistence unit
(you should only need to un-comment the relevant parts):
 
----
<persistence-unit name="jpademo">
     <provider>org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider</provider>
     <exclude-unlisted-classes>false</exclude-unlisted-classes>
     <properties>
          <property name="eclipselink.logging.level" value="INFO" />
          <property name="eclipselink.target-database" value="MySQL"/>
          <property name="eclipselink.ddl-generation"
               value="drop-and-create-tables" />
         <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.driver"
               value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" />
          <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url"
               value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jpademo.db"/>
          <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.user" value="student" />
          <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.password" value="student" />
     </properties>
</persistence-unit>
----

Obviously if you used a differnet username and/or a stronger password you will need to substitute them here.

You should now be able to run the _jpademo_ programs and examine the results using the MySQL Workbench.
